# Part 1 – Dataset Experiments

## Dataset A

place holder

## Dataset B

### Hard Unipolar Activation

#### Training Split 75/25

- _Training Plot:_ `B_train_hard_75.png`
- _Testing Plot:_ `B_test_hard_25.png`
- Training Total Error: [value]

**Confusion Matrix (Testing Data)**

|                 | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Actual Positive | TP = [ ]           | FN = [ ]           |
| Actual Negative | FP = [ ]           | TN = [ ]           |

**Rates**

- Accuracy: [ ]
- True Positive Rate (Recall): [ ]
- False Positive Rate: [ ]
- Precision: [ ]
- F1 Score: [ ]

#### Comparison of 75/25 vs 25/75

- **a. Are error rates different, and if so, why?**

- **b. What is the effect of different datasets and the effect of different training/testing distributions of TEs on the accuracy, confusion matrices, and rates?**

- **c. When would you go with step 1 (75/25) and when with step 2 (25/75)?**

- **d. Comment and discuss.**
